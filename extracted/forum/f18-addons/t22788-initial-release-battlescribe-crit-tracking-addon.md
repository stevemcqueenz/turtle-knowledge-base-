Overview

BattleScribe automatically monitors your combat log and records the maximum normal and critical values for every ability you use. Whether you're testing gear, comparing talent builds, or just want to know your personal bests, BattleScribe keeps track of it all.

Features

 **Combat Tracking**
 - Tracks maximum normal and critical damage/healing for each ability
 - Automatically detects spell icons from your spellbook
 - Separates abilities by type (damage vs healing)
 - Maintains both session-only and all-time records

 **Statistics**
Hover over any ability to see detailed statistics:
 - Crit rate percentage
 - Average damage for normal and critical hits
 - Total damage/healing dealt
 - Minimum and maximum values
 - Total hit count

 **Ability Statistics Tooltip**

 **Interface**
 - Resizable frame (width and height)
 - Compact mode below 250px width shows icons only
 - Sortable columns - click headers to sort by name, normal, or crit values
 - Draggable window with persistent position
 - Alternating row colors for readability
 - Smart tooltip positioning - automatically adjusts to stay on screen

 **Filtering**
 - **Time Period**: View all-time records or current session only
 - **Ability Type**: Show all abilities, damage only, or healing only
 - Filter settings persist between sessions

 **Settings**
 - **Hide in Combat**: Toggle to automatically hide the addon window during combat
 - All UI preferences persist between sessions
 - Settings accessible via cogwheel icon in the title bar

 **Data Management**
 - Character-specific tracking
 - All settings and data saved automatically
 - Reset option to clear data when needed

 **Installation**

 1. Download the addon
 2. Extract to `Interface/AddOns/BattleScribe`
 3. Restart World of Warcraft
 4. Type `/bs` to open the tracker

 **Commands**

 - `/bs` or `/battlescribe` - Toggle the main window

 - `/bs help` - Show available commands

 **Usage**

The addon starts tracking automatically once loaded. Open the window with `/bs` to view your records. Click the cogwheel icon to access settings for filtering and data management.

 **Performance**

BattleScribe is optimized for minimal memory usage:
 - Updates only when records are broken
 - Reuses UI frames to prevent memory growth
 - Caches spell icons after first lookup
 - No performance impact during sustained combat
